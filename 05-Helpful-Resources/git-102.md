# Git 102

This document is a guide to solving common problems with git. To get a more basic undersanding of git, please refer to this [file](./git-101.md).

## Common Problems with Git

### How to go back if you've messed up?

- Regular Files
    - If you have worked on file/files and they broke things and you don't want to look at them, you can just use `git reset`. This will revert your code to the last commit that was working (if it was ever working).

        - [More documentation on git reset](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset)

    - If you committed something that messed up your codebase and you want to get back to a commit that used to work, you can check out what commits you have by `git log --oneline` and then you can copy and paste the commit number and reset your code to the earlier commit `git reset [commit-number here]`
        

- Jupyter Notebook files
    - More or less, try not to use git too much for Jupyter Notebooks as git and `.ipynb` files don't play nicely with each other
    - To avoid working conflicts with others, I highly recommend working on very small chunks of code in Jupyter Notebook files and then combining them later

### Strategies for Resolving Merge Conflicts

- Ask your TAs or Dartanion

### Why do files disappear when I change branches?
 - Short Answer: this is a feature, not a bug. If there are different files that don't exist in different branches, they disappear. You can merge branches to each other to add files to one branch that exists on another branch.
 - Long Answer: The histories of 2 different branches have diverged. One branch is ahead of another. When this happens, you can check difference between branches by putting in this command `git diff [branch1]...[branch2]`

### When to use GitHub Desktop? When to use command line? Are there other options?
- GitHub desktop or other Graphic User Interfaces (GUI) for Git just runs command line on the background.
- To better manage git repos between many people, it helps to visualize your git branches, so a software like GitHub Desktop can help. However, if it is confusing, don't use it.
- Other options for Git GUI are [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), [SmartGit](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/)
