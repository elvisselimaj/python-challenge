# Git 101

## What is Git?

Git is a software that helps you keep track of changes to files in a folder on your computer. We will be using it to keep our code, update them, share, and collaborate with others in the class. It is an essential tool in the toolkit for software developers and data scientists.

## Helpful Terminal Commands

  * `cd` (Changes the directory).
  * `cd ~` (Changes to the home directory).
  * `cd ..` (Moves up one directory).
  * `ls` (Lists files in the folder).
  * `pwd` (Shows the current directory).
  * `mkdir <FOLDERNAME>` (Creates a new directory with the FOLDERNAME).
  * `touch <FILENAME>` (Creates a new file with the FILENAME).
  * `rm <FILENAME>` (Deletes a file).
  * `rm -r <FOLDERNAME>` (Deletes a folder, make sure to note the -r).
  * `open .` (Opens the current folder on Macs).
  * `explorer .` (Opens the current folder on GitBash).
  * `open <FILENAME>` (Opens a specific file on Macs).
  * `explorer <FILENAME>` (Opens a specific file on GitBash).

## Pushing to GitHub
Be sure to remember the following when pushing up to your GitHub repository:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
git push
```
If you get a message indicating that you need to tell Git who you are, then you can also run the following command (replace the sample e-mail address with your own) and they rerun the commands above.

`git config --global user.name "your name here"`
`git config --global user.email "your@emailaddress.here"`

## Git Tutorials

Here are some resources to learn git quickly

## Git, GitHub, GitLab

Git is the technology that powers software development. It's a standard. Sites like GitHub and GitLab just lets you put your code on the "cloud" so others can see. GitHub is the largest open source community in the world where millions share their codes. It powers most tech companies' software that's hosted on the web. GitLab is just another place you can put your code. GitLab tends to be private, GitHub is by default public, unless you pay for it to have private repositories. There are other products like BitBucket, AWS Code Commit, etc that do the same thing.

## Git use cases

In this class, you will be using Git for several things.

1. You will get your activities, homeworks, project requirements from GitLab, which the Instructional team will push to, and which you can pull down on your local machine
2. You will use GitHub to submit all your homeworks. You can push your code to GitHub similarly to how you were able to pull down the GitLab repositories.
3. You will use Git and GitHub to manage your group project codebase. This will involve branches, pull requests, and some headaches.

By the end of this class, you will have a GitHub portfolio of projects, exercises, etc that employers will be impressed by. 

## Other Resources

To effectively use Git, you need a bit of knowledge in using the command line (terminal, command prompt, gitbash depending on your platform).
Here are some resources to get you familiar with those
- Command line tutorials
	- [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)
	- [A funny, sometimes mean, but very useful tutorial](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendix-a-cli/introduction.html)


*While we recommend using the command line*, you can also use GUIs (Graphic User Interfaces), which are just fancy User Interface Software that don't require you to use the command line, to also manage your Git repos

Here are a few
