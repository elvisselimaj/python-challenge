Have you ever been charged with creating one cohesive report and summary based on several Excel workbooks or worksheets? This activity will allow for you to utilize all of the skills that you have learned so far to produce a report in Excel.

## Instructions

* Using the data from the `Demographics`, `Contact Info`, `Diagnosis`, and `Students` tabs, create a full report and populate each of the fields in the `Full Report` tab
* Be sure that the name is formatted as "[Last], [First] [Middle]", for example "Williams, Dartanion De Angelo"
* Now I want to test your resourcefulness, so figure out how to calculate age
* Use conditional formatting to highlight the entire row for each individual diagnosed as "Fierce" in red
* Use conditional formatting to highlight the _only the age cell_ for each individual that is 21 or under in green
* Once you have populate all fields, convert the report into a formatted table
* Produce a Pivot Table in a new worksheet that groups the data by diagnosis (get as creative as you want with this)

_Work together as pairs. Since this is a special exercise, the first two winning pairs will receive a special award._
