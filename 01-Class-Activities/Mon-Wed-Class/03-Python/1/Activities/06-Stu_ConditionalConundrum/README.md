## The conditional puzzle

### Instructions

#### Part 1
* Look through the examples and figure out what line will print.

* Do not run the code at first, see if you can follow the thought process and guess.

#### Part 2
Now that we understand that Python will read any non-blank value in as `True` when cast to `boolean`, figure out a way to read in a "real" `boolean` (`True` or `False`) value from the user's input
Hint: Use Logic to convert values, such as
* Convert values, such as 'True', 'Yes', or 1 to `True`
* Convert values, such as 'False', 'No', or 0 to `False`
