## VBA Overview

### What Is VBA?
VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) is a programming language that helps automate tasks in Excel. It is possible to use VBA to do just about anything that you can normally do in Excel. For example, you can write a VBA program to combine worksheets, perform advanced calculations, format reports, among other tasks.

## What are some advantages of VBA?
Excel allows for you to record macros, which will generate VBA code that allows for you to repeat those steps. You can also write code in VBA that makes it easy and user friendly for a user of your workbook to perform a set of steps consistently. You can control workflow by creating buttons and implement functionality that makes what to do very clear to the user.

## What are some disadvantages of VBA?
One limitation, not necessarily disadvantage is that VBA is designed for use with Excel. It can also have a steep learning curve if you are not used to the Visual Basic programming language. VBA code isn't always easy to migrate and debugging can sometimes be difficult.
